Algorithm DFS(G,u):

  Input:  A graph G and a vertex u of G
  Output: A collectiom of vertices that are reachable from u with discovery edges
  
  Mark vertex u as visited 
  for each of u's outgoing edges, e=(u,v) do
    if vertex v has not been visited then
       Record edge e as the discovery edge for vertex v
       DFS(G, v)
